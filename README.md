Geogram is a programming library with geometric algorithms. It has
geometry-processing functionalities:
- [surface reconstruction](https://github.com/BrunoLevy/geogram/wiki/Reconstruction)
- [remeshing](https://github.com/BrunoLevy/geogram/wiki/Remeshing)
- [parameterization and texturing](https://github.com/BrunoLevy/geogram/wiki/Texturing)

It also has lower-level algorithm:
- [Delaunay triangulations in 2D](https://github.com/BrunoLevy/geogram/wiki/Delaunay2D)
  and [in 3D](https://github.com/BrunoLevy/geogram/wiki/Delaunay3D)
- Memory efficient surfacic/volumetric/hybdir [mesh data structure](https://github.com/BrunoLevy/geogram/wiki/Mesh)
- Efficient [geometric search data structures](https://github.com/BrunoLevy/geogram/wiki/Raytrace) for
  intersection and raytracing (AABBs, KdTrees, ...)
- [Spectral mesh processing](https://github.com/BrunoLevy/geogram/wiki/ManifoldHarmonics)
- [Linear solver on CPU and GPU](https://github.com/BrunoLevy/geogram/wiki/OpenNL)

Geogram contains the main results in Geometry Processing from the former
ALICE Inria project, that is, more than 30 research articles published
in ACM SIGGRAPH, ACM Transactions on Graphics, Symposium on Geometry 
Processing and Eurographics. It was supported by two grants from the
European Research Council (ERC): GOODSHAPE and VORPALINE.
